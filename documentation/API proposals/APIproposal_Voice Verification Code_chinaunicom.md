| API family owner | ChinaUnicom |
| API summary | This API allows the caller (application server/Internet device/software/mobile phone client, such as mobile phone App, Web, PC client, soft terminal, etc.) to send verification code to the called mobile phone users quickly and accurately by voice call based on IMS network in the way of calling with the application, so as to avoid the disadvantage of prolonged receipt of SMS verification code and easy interception, and improve users' perception. This API can solve the following problems: 1) Security Enhancement: It solves the problem that SMS verification codes may be vulnerable to mobile Trojans and information leaks. Voice verification codes have a higher security experience and can effectively protect the security of user data, making them suitable for scenarios with high authentication requirements. 2) Improving customer experience: Voice verification codes provide faster verification speed and higher accuracy, reducing user input errors and complaint rates. 3) Verify user identity: In business scenarios related to user identity security, such as remote login, identity verification, payment verification, etc., voice verification codes are highly effective preventive measures. 4) High arrival rate: The arrival rate of voice verification codes is close to 100%, and they will not be missed due to interception or other reasons. |
| Technical viability | By invoking  the voice verification code API, users can initiate outbound calls for voice verification code broadcasting based on IMS audio channels for specific called mobile phone user. This API supports the submission of various content formats such as text to speech (TTS), voice files, variable templates, etc., to meet the multi scenario usage needs of customers. |
| Commercial viability | For use in  user registration, important information changes, dynamic verification codes, payment confirmation, and other scenarios. |
